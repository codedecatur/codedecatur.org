Code Decatur is excited to announce that we're leveling up our goals for the year! We want to take a more active role in our coding community by creating weekly tutorials, releasing updates on projects we've developed, and giving you guys more cool stuff to look at. 

In more detail, we plan to release weekly tutorials made by our members at a variety of levels. We hope that we can help you out with something you may be stuck on, or inspire you to create an awesome new project. We're also planning to make small videos (what we're calling shorts). Shorts will be videos of things like games our members code, robots running around, and other visual projects we create.

Make sure to follow us on Instagram at @codedecatur to see our shorts and stay updated with our new content! Let us know if you have any ideas or suggestions for shorts we can make. Happy coding!
