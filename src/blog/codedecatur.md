#Cybersecurity Club has been reborn as Code Decatur

Cybersecurity Club was a fun and enjoyable experience (hopefully) to those involved. However, we decided to take the action of rebranding to Code Decatur, as we felt we were limiting our membership and not providing
enough support for Computer Science here in Decatur.  

Code Decatur will offer a variety of tutorials at all skill levels authored by our members at Code Decatur.   
We hope we can encourage Decatur to be more actively involved in Computer Science, and would love to pave the way for more Computer Science pathways.
